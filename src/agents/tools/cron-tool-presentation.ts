ACTIONS: status | list [includeDisabled,limit?,offset?] (compact summaries with timing; use nextOffset for the next page) | get jobId (full schedule, payload, and delivery details) | add job | update jobId job (partial: only supplied fields change; null clears) | remove jobId (operator removal requests cancellation of an active run; the result reports activeRunCancellationRequested:true) | run jobId (runMode "force"=now; waits up to timeoutMs, default 60s, and returns the finished run: status, error, deliveryStatus, summary; a longer run, or a main-session job that starts after this turn, returns runId — check it later with runs jobId runId, never with a scheduled verify job) | runs jobId runId? = history | wake text enqueues a normal follow-up in the caller-owned session (sessionKey/agentId to pick another).

SCOPE: Authenticated configured channel owner and Control UI administrator turns can list/get/update/run/remove any Gateway automation. Other turns see only caller-visible jobs; totals/counts and hasMore describe that scoped view, not global inventory. In that restricted view, an empty list or failed list/get/update/remove (including not-found) does not establish global absence, whatever the source of a known job id (including your own history). Never recreate or replace a known automation to satisfy an update/remove or reconciliation request solely because of these results. Report that you cannot establish global absence and ask an authorized administrator to check through a fresh authenticated configured channel owner or Control UI administrator turn or the Automations page. Genuinely new, requested automations can still be created.

ADD: job requires schedule+payload.

SCHEDULE:
- {kind:"at",at:"ISO-8601"} one-shot; no tz=UTC; auto-deletes after successful completion: delivery confirmed, not requested, intentionally silent, or explicitly bestEffort. Failed/unknown required delivery retains it disabled.
- {kind:"every",everyMs}.
- {kind:"cron",expr,tz?:"IANA"}: expr is wall time in tz; never pre-convert to UTC; no tz=gateway host local. 18:00 Shanghai => {expr:"0 18 * * *",tz:"Asia/Shanghai"}.${streamScheduleLine}

TARGET+PAYLOAD:
- "current" (agentTurn default) = this conversation: the run stays detached, reads bounded chat context, then commits its final visible assistant result to this conversation's durable history. Delayed work/loop = at|every + agentTurn + current. This is not a resumed parent turn: it uses the scheduled agent workspace with its own session identity, not the conversation worktree or cloud worker placement. In-flight turns sent through the job's stable cron key are canceled if that key is reassigned. Verify required checkout/tool access before delegating repository work; result delivery alone does not resume the original agent.
- "isolated" = fresh detached session; standalone background work recorded in cron run history.
- "main" = normal main-session follow-up; payload {kind:"systemEvent",text} (systemEvent default target). The run waits for actual execution and delivery.
- "session:<key>" = named session.
- {kind:"agentTurn",message,includeReasoning?}; includeReasoning includes reasoning only alongside a meaningful delivered result; timeoutSeconds 0=none.
- Inherited configured MCP authority includes only model-callable tools; interactive app-view-only capabilities are excluded from headless jobs.${scriptPayloadLine}

PACED LOOP: recurring job + pacing{min?,max?} durations ("15m","4h"; at least one). Inside its run, job calls next_check in:"<dur>" to set the next delay (clamped to bounds, measured from run end; failed runs keep normal backoff). Adaptive polling: tighten when active, back off when quiet.

AUTHORING (recurring): every fire re-runs the same instructions; keep the model for judgment only. Put repeatable logic (listing/diffing, dedupe, checkpoints/watermarks) in a workspace script the payload runs in one exec; keep detailed instructions in a workspace file beside it that the message references ("Follow scripts/<job>.md"), so fixes need only file edits. Message names exact tool ids + argument shapes; cap toolsAllow to what the run needs.${scriptCue}

${triggerSection}

DELIVERY: where detached run output goes. Omitted=announce (current=>canonical session commit, plus one normal channel send for external chats; isolated=>last route or creating-conversation commit when no external route exists; set channel/to for a specific chat — no messaging tool inside the run). Conversation delivery succeeds after the history commit; WebChat sees it live and after reconnect.${silentWatcherCue} webhook posts finished-run event (successful empty summary is intentional silence, no POST) to URL in \`to\`. To keep announce delivery and also POST completion, use mode:"announce" with completionDestination:{mode:"webhook",to:"https://..."}.

FAILURE ALERTS: jobs with a failure route default to alerting after 2 consecutive execution failures with a 1h cooldown. Route order: job failureAlert fields, delivery.failureDestination over global cron.failureAlert destination fields, then primary announce. failureAlert:false disables execution/delivery alerts, not the auto-disable safety notice; a failureAlert object activates/tunes. bestEffort suppresses inherited execution alerts. Required completion-delivery failure uses only an alternate route, bypasses after, and shares the execution-alert cooldown from the first failure; it does not increment the execution streak.

Optional job policy: activeHours{start,end,timezone?} is an end-exclusive execution window (including manual runs); idleOnly yields to foreground work. delivery.target:"owner" resolves the owner DM dynamically, never the last group; delivery.directPolicy:"block" prohibits DMs. agentTurn skipIfScratchEmpty skips an explicitly empty checklist, not missing scratch. jobId canonical (id=compat). contextMessages 0-10 embeds recent chat lines into reminder text.`;
